### Project Summary

**Title: Analysis and Visualization of Brazilian Economic Indicators**

This project involves fetching and analyzing historical economic data from Brazil's Central Bank's public API. The project focuses on two critical economic indicators: the SELIC rate (Brazilian Treasury Bonds) and the IPCA rate (Brazilian Inflation Rate). The data is cleaned, transformed, and visualized to observe trends and relationships between these indicators over time.

### Key Features:
- **Data Extraction:** Used the Central Bank of Brazil's API to fetch historical SELIC and IPCA data.
- **Data Processing:** Converted date and value fields to appropriate formats for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Created line plots to visualize trends in SELIC and IPCA rates individually and a combined plot with dual axes to observe their relationship.

### Key Skills:
- **APIs:** Central Bank of Brazil API
- **Programming:** Python (Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Data Processing:** Data cleaning, merging, and transformation using Pandas
- **Data Visualization:** Line plotting with Matplotlib, dual-axis plotting for comparative analysis
